## Overview

Stack0X is a unified platform that brings decentralized infrastructure to everyday users. Built on top of SuiStack0X technology, it provides a complete ecosystem for browsing, deploying, and interacting with decentralized applications.

The platform seamlessly integrates the four core modules of SuiStack0X:
- **Compute Module**: Serverless functions with TEE protection
- **Edge Module**: Decentralized content delivery
- **Index Module**: High-performance blockchain data indexing
- **Deploy Module**: Trustless CI/CD pipeline

## Key Integrations

Stack0X leverages key components of the Sui ecosystem:

### SuiNS Integration
- Native resolution of `.sui` domains
- Secure browsing with TEE protection indicators
- Multiple resolution methods (browser extension, gateway service, local DNS resolver)
- Human-readable addressing for decentralized applications

### Walrus Integration
- Seamless content delivery from decentralized storage
- Dynamic content serving through Edge module
- Static site enhancement with serverless API capabilities
- True "static+" sites that overcome Walrus limitations with SuiStack0X compute functions

### SuiPlay0X1 Integration
- Unified authentication system across platforms
- Shared resource allocation and management
- Complementary gaming infrastructure capabilities
- Cross-platform profile synchronization

## Platform Components

### 1. Stack0X Web Browser

The browser interface maintains the SuiStack0X color scheme and design language while offering essential features:

* **Secure browsing** of `.sui` domains with built-in security indicators
* **Integrated wallet** for seamless blockchain interactions
* **App store access** directly from the browser
* **Dashboard** for monitoring resource usage
* **Sidebar navigation** for quick access to all platform services

Key features include:
* TEE-protected browsing with visual security indicators
* Categorized browsing experience for DeFi, Games, NFTs, etc.
* Recently visited .sui domains with favorites functionality
* Dark/light mode toggle for user preference

### 2. Mobile App Experience

The Stack0X mobile app delivers a complete experience with four key sections:

* **Home tab**: Wallet management, quick actions, app shortcuts, and activity feed
* **App Store tab**: Discover and install decentralized applications
* **Browser tab**: Mobile-optimized web3 browsing experience
* **Dashboard tab**: Monitor node performance and resource usage

The mobile interface includes:
* Balance card with staking information
* Resource usage visualizations
* TEE security indicators throughout the experience
* Quick access to essential functions

### 3. Desktop Application

The Stack0X desktop application serves as a powerful node management platform:

* **Complete dashboard** with comprehensive metrics
* **Node management** interface for controlling compute/edge/index/deploy nodes
* **Resource allocation** and monitoring
* **Advanced charting** capabilities for system metrics
* **Storage management** and distribution visualization

Special features include:
* Detailed resource credit management
* Node health monitoring with status indicators
* Activity logs for all infrastructure components
* Dark/light mode that matches the system theme

## Key Design Principles

Throughout all three platforms, these design principles are maintained:

1. **Consistent color scheme** matching SuiStack0X:
   * Primary colors: deep indigo with blue undertones
   * Secondary colors: teal accent colors
   * Module-specific colors (compute/edge/index/deploy)

2. **TEE security indicators** prominently displayed when:
   * Browsing secure .sui domains
   * Using TEE-protected apps
   * Executing functions on protected infrastructure

3. **Resource monitoring** across all platforms:
   * Compute usage metrics
   * Edge delivery statistics
   * Index performance
   * Deploy pipeline status
   
4. **Unified experience** that feels cohesive whether on web, mobile or desktop

## SuiStack0X Technology

Stack0X is built on SuiStack0X, a comprehensive decentralized infrastructure platform that provides:

- **True Serverless APIs**: Unlike traditional static site hosting, SuiStack0X enables fully functional backend capabilities through its Compute module, allowing developers to move beyond the limitations of static hosting.

- **Enterprise-Grade Backend**: SuiStack0X replaces traditional cloud providers like AWS with decentralized, TEE-secured infrastructure capable of handling enterprise workloads.

- **TEE Security**: All execution happens in Trusted Execution Environments, providing cryptographic guarantees for data privacy and execution integrity.

- **Decentralized Routing**: Multiple methods to access decentralized content through the Edge module, working seamlessly with SuiNS domains.

## Architecture Benefits

Stack0X offers several key advantages:

1. **Better than IPFS + Jamstack**: While Walrus provides static site hosting, Stack0X extends this capability with true serverless functionality, making it a complete replacement for traditional web infrastructure.

2. **Unified Resource Management**: A single platform to manage compute, edge delivery, indexing, and deployment needs.

3. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: The same secure experience whether on web, mobile, or desktop.

4. **Enterprise Readiness**: Designed to handle enterprise-grade backend needs with the security and scalability of decentralized infrastructure.
